<h1 align="center"> Capture The Flags </h1>

<p>This repository contains several folders named after their (pawned) boxes in websites such as Tryhackme and Hackthebox. 
Each folder is a m√©lange of data collected while solving the challenges. You will expect to find the following:</p>

-Answers to some questions (not the actual flag);

-Tools and programs used to solve the challenge: Enumeration, Priv-Esc, Looting, Post-Exploitation, etc.

-Useful commands that solved answers.

-Recon data collected (mostly) during Enumeration.

<p>Use it as an add-on when solving these challenges. This information will guide you to the right direction but will not give you the answer to the problems. 
For any questions, feel free to message me. 

Have fun! </p>
